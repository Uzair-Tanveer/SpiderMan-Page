# SpiderMan-Page

This page was created as my first HTML and JavaScript project to better learn and get used to HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The actual page is simple and direct. It is a spiderman tribute type page that just has gifs and pictures of spiderman, while also having JavaScript embedded to increase the user interaction and to give a more stylish and user-friendly feeling. 

The JavaScript used was to create a collapsable nav that would pull out on the left of the page, and would close when clicked again. The pictures contained JavaScript to a funtion that would enlarge the pictures when a user would hover over the picture. The page also contained music in the background that would automatically play when the page first loads, which would automatically pause when the video is played. The video also contained the same function as the image, for it would automtically enlarge for a better viewing experience when the play button is pressed, and would decrease to its original size when it is paused. The footer also included a button that would show the copyright when clocked in a popup format, which would show for a set amout of time and then disappear.

(The music and video are excluded from this file due to them being too big to upload into the repository.)
